    <h2>1.Escape to the jungle with your lover – Escape in Bali</h2>
    <h3>While Bali is known for being crowded, on a romantic escape you want to have a little quiet time with each other. Just imagine being able to take a nap or lounge on a hammock that’s hanging over the most gorgeous, lush jungle you’ve ever seen.</h3>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h3>Escape in Bali is a quaint little wooden hut that’s hidden in the jungles of Bali, on the outskirts of Ubud, in Gianyar. It’s the perfect place to feel like you’ve been stranded in a jungle. Completely made from bamboo, there’s an almost peaceful aspect to it as you connect with nature.</h3>
    <h3>Of course, take the romance one step further as you hop in their outdoor plunge pool, surrounded by endless greenery, and overlooking a gorgeous horizon, the feeling of pure bliss will never leave you during your stay!</h3>

    <h2>24. Infinite ocean views from a traditional boat: MÏnoo Beach Club</h2>
    <h3>Washing up on the shore of romantic Melasti Beach (where couples flock to for gorgeous pre-wedding photoshoots), MÏnoo Beach Club is still considered a hidden gem where you can get relatively affordable snacks and cocktails – which is uncommon in Ungasan, an area known for its luxury resorts and glamorous beach clubs with equally bling price tags.</h3>
    <h3>In other words – over here, you get to enjoy the Melasti beach sunset without the crowd and hefty price!</h3>
    <h3>MÏnoo’s iconic traditional fishing boat (also known as a Jukung), perched right on its beachfront infinity pool, is the first thing you will notice as you step in. It’s also undoubtedly an impressive vantage point – and of course an Instagrammable photo spot – where you can swim up, cocktail in hand, and be closer to the ocean on deck!</h3>
    <h3>It’s no surprise that MÏnoo is synonymous with ‘paradise’ in Persian – think lazy Ibiza vibes with toes in the sand, while weekends are jazzed up by DJs at sunset!</h3>

    <h2>25. Sip a drink in a 300+-year-old sacred temple! – Ji Terrace By The Sea at Ji Restaurant</h2>
    <h3>Ji Terrace By The Sea at Hotel Tugu is a hidden treasure on the West coast of Bali. The perching spot had me booze in hand and face-to-face with some of the best views in Canggu – the island’s hipster neighbourhood.</h3>
    <h3>I love the inspiration behind the interiors of this venue. The fact that you need to go through a restaurant, climb a set of stairs, and know to look for an exotic, tropical terrace makes it pretty cool. Inside, the drinks are made with a unique Asian precision that separates it from the rest of Bali’s sunset bar crowd.</h3>
    <h3>As I settled into a roster of stunning cocktails, I also enjoyed a 180° view over the sparkling Indian Ocean. The exclusive venue did not fail to showcase the beauty of Asia – I saw it, felt it and even tasted it! There are alluring statues and artworks scattered all around while you’ll even find an antique museum on the hotel grounds. Talk about cultural immersion!</h3>
    <h3>Now, if luck is on your side and you decide to pop by during the weekend, perhaps you’ll love to sign up for their Weekend at Ji (Friday to Sunday) with an eclectic programme including DJ sessions, Sunset Happy Hours and a memorable Sunday Brunch!</h3>
    <h3>With their extremely well thought out concept, you’ll get to indulge in an all-you-can-eat a-la-carte menu with an extensive range of food items like sushi, sashimi, meat dishes, rice dishes, fresh salads and much more, all made fresh upon order.</h3>
    <h3>With good food, expertly-made concoctions, postcard-perfect views and an entertaining kids’ corner for your little ones, you’re in for a complete treat at Ji Terrace. And if you’re here on a special occasion, book yourself a traditional Indonesian dinner at Tugu Bali Restaurant. Complemented with a romantic setting, you’ll also get to enjoy traditional dance performances on specific nights.</h3>

    <h2>26. Relish Bali’s sunset magic at this cosy clifftop oceanfront restaurant – Abracadabra at Mu Boutique Resort</h2>
    <h3>Sunsets in Bali are simply magical. They are just somehow more romantic and epic, with Bali’s natural landscapes as the backdrop – a must “couple thing to do” when in Bali with your loved one.</h3>
    <h3>While some of us love watching the sun set over <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/bali-sea-temples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uluwatu Temple</a> with monkeys and the cultural Kecak Dance, some prefer to stroll hand-in-hand along <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/best-beaches-bali/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bali’s best beaches</a>.</h3>
    <h3>Personally, there’s nothing better than watching the sunset with a glass of cocktail and a romantic dinner right on Uluwatu’s cliff front with crashing waves below. And this is exactly what you will experience at Abracadabra.</h3>
    <h3>Here, you get front-row seats to Mother Nature’s best performance, while you are served fresh (and mostly organic) fruit and vegetables from a local farm in the mountainous regions of the island.</h3>
    <h3>You can also choose from a variety of healthy (and hearty) homemade pasta to grilled seafood, and end your meal with gelato or organic sorbetto.</h3>
    <h3>And if you are into fresh juices, there’s also a juice bar on the property that’s open all day!</h3>

    <h2>27. Match your seafood culinary delights with ocean hues (seafood) – Seasalt Seminyak</h2>
    <h3>When it comes to living the high life, seafood reigns supreme at this vibrant open-kitchen restaurant that serves Japanese-inspired meals with a whole new definition!</h3>
    <h3>Located on the seaside of Bali, Seasalt Seminyak (at Alila Seminyak) – a decoratively decadent eatery (famed for its coastal dining concept) gives seafood the gratuitously luxurious twist it needs.</h3>
    <h3>Who wants a boring seafood platter when you can have a jumbo fish baked and served in sea salt, as though it was hidden under the sand… while a few seashells adorn your delectable meal and give it photo-worthy opportunities (order their White Snapper!).</h3>
    <h3>If you are a fan of treats from the ocean prepared in creative, unique and mouth-watering ways, dining at Seasalt Seminyak will be a pleasure, especially because your meal gets naturally salted while you sit by the ocean.</h3>
    <h3>The fine dining restaurant sources its seafood from the surrounding ocean so you can always expect the freshest selections used for their superb quality oceanic dishes. The chefs master the art of magnifying the flavours of high quality and fresh ingredients – such as the Miso-honey roasted butterfish with carrot puree and pickled carrot.</h3>
    <h3>While you savour fantastic seafood and relish in the magnificent ocean views; there’s something wonderfully tactile about eating food from the sea by the sea — cracking through the claw, slurping shells and dipping fingers into lemon-scented bowls while the ocean breeze runs through your hair…</h3>
    <h3>Of course, if you were to ask us, it helps enormously that seafood goes very well with a glass of crisp white wine. ;)</h3>

    <h2>28. Take a trip to Latin America – Barbacoa</h2>
    <h3>A Latin American restaurant specialising in BBQ meats, Barbacoa is a carnivore’s dream. Their secret lies in the meticulous process – their whole pigs are slow-roasted over the Asado pit, allowing the meat to bask in the smouldering embrace of natural wood, resulting in a juicy, fall-off-the-bone dish that is bound to surprise your palate.</h3>
    <h3>But the indulgence doesn’t stop there. Barbacoa also offers an amazing selection of beef, lamb, chicken, seafood, and vegetable dishes, all charred to perfection.</h3>
    <h3>Unsurprisingly, the cocktail menu boasts a Latin American flair, showcasing a captivating array of concoctions that weave together unique flavour combinations, with tastes that transport your senses to distant lands.</h3>
    <h3>End your romantic evening at their wine cellar which boasts an extensive selection of both new and old-world wines, spanning varying vintages. Recently, the cellar has welcomed the addition of natural wines and biodynamic elixirs.</h3>
    <h3>As you sip and savour, the ambience of Barbacoa enchants with its warehouse-style charm, featuring high ceilings, recycled wood, mosaic-tiled floors, and sandstone walls. Vintage leather banquettes beckon you to relax, all while the fully ducted AC ensures your comfort.</h3>
    <h3>As you enjoy your cocktails and wines, a picturesque view unfolds – the restaurant gazes over lush rice paddies, creating a backdrop that complements the romantic atmosphere.</h3>

    <h2>31. Take a romantic stroll among the blessed marigolds: Taman Edelweis Bali</h2>

    <h3>Indeed, the most memorable moments are the most silent and serene ones. When a bouquet is not enough; you offer a whole field of flowers! Marigold flower has a very prominent significance to the Balinese culture (with regards to its Indian origin). In fact, the flower is often associated with the sun due to its vibrant orange and yellow colour.</h3>
    <h3>Time to remind your lover that they’re that one person who makes your day brighter! Marigolds are symbols of passion and creativity – often used as love charms depicting the beauty of marriage and a sign of fresh beginning for newly married couples.</h3>
    <h3>Take a walk and spend quality time enjoying what nature has to offer to you both – complete aesthetic visuals and tranquillity guaranteed.</h3>
    <h3>With its stunningly colorful orange flowers, it is hands-down the best spot for couple selfies with Mount Agung as backdrop too.</h3>
    <h3>You might also spot some Kasna flower fields and relish in the peaceful white ambience of glory and its beautiful scenery. Both Marigold and Kasna flowers are used as a sign of worship in Bali and are believed to be blessed.</h3>

    <h3>The best time to visit Gili Putih is early in the morning at sunrise or in the evening at sunset as you can relish beautiful sky colours and enjoy the change in tides! Best yet if you can stay from sunrise to sunset to fully contemplate how different the scenery is throughout the whole day!</h3>
    <h3>From the island, you can even enjoy magical views of the nearby West Bali National Park.</h3>
    <h3>Now, this is the ideal location if, just like me, you hate crowded beaches at golden hours! And if you’re wondering how to reach the island in time for Mother Nature’s show, do not worry as locals at Bangsal Harbour will be more than happy to help you out with a boat ride!</h3>

    <h2>33. Mount Batur’s Volcanic Landscape, viewed from Pinggan village</h2>
    <h3>Mount Batur (1,717m) is the most visited volcano in Bali, but most visitors usually join the tourist hordes at Kintamani village for views of the majestic fire-breather.</h3>
    <h3>For a view of Batur that’s arguably more spectacular, we suggest you head to the more isolated village of Pinggan.</h3>
    <h3>Here you can experience the fierce splendour of the active volcano in a more solitary, meditative setting.</h3>
    <h3>Batur is at its most photogenic at sunrise and sunset, and even makes for impressive night photography – with the lights of Pinggan village spread out at the foot of the mountain, and a sky full of stars twinkling above the peak.</h3>

    <strong>Getting There:</strong> Most Mount Batur tours don’t stop at Pinggan village (which is why it makes it so gloriously uncrowded), so you’re best getting there on your own steam. Ubud is the nearest major tourist hub and Pinggan is about 45km, or an hour’s drive away.</h3>

But you now know better – here’s where you can find hidden gems the mainstream crowd doesn’t know.</h3>
    <h3>Sawangan Beach is a perfect example of this, a public beach located in front of the <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/hilton-bali-resort-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hilton Bali Resort</a>, and the best part is that it’s almost empty (that is if you can keep the secret)!

    <h2>35. Explore sacred spaces at the Secret Canyon of Sukawati</h2>
    <h3>Near Pura Beji Guwang in Sukawati, there’s a sacred, secret canyon that’s so incredible, that it’s sure to inspire anyone and everyone.</h3>
    <h3>For any artist, photographer, creative, or simply anyone who wants to be wowed by a real-life view of nature’s masterpiece – this secret canyon is a must-visit.</h3>
    <h3>The craziest thing about this canyon is if you look hard enough – it is so uniquely shaped, one can even see a crying skull and other faces (lions?!) in the abstract landscape. And if that’s not enough, the colours around make for an amazing visual feast too.</h3>
    <h3>Sit on the flat of the canyon rocks, and dangle your feet while admiring the view – or get a little crazy and see how much deeper you can go into the canyon. (Make sure you’re as safe and careful as possible, of course!)</h3>
    <h3>When getting here, do be ultra careful as you will have to pass several rivers with a sticky muddy floor, and you might also have to climb some big slippery rocks. You might also be walking in the water in some sections.</h3>
    <h3>Other than that, feel free to explore to your heart’s content and fully appreciate this magnificent find!</h3>
    <h3><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">P.S. It takes around 2-3 hours to complete the entire trek.</span></em></h3>

    <h2>38. Make Indonesian batik! – Widya Batik</h2>
    <h3>As you walk around in Bali, you may notice some of the locals wearing bright, beautifully-patterned sarongs and shirts. For those of you who aren’t familiar with this print, it’s called batik.</h3>
    <h3>Known as an ancient art form for many Indonesians, batik is made with wax and plant-based dye.</h3>
    <h3>There are two ways to apply the wax to cotton to create a batik design. One method entails draping cloth over a frame and subsequently drawing with a canting (a copper and often bamboo-handled spout). The canting is dipped in heated wax and applied to the material as you draw out the print you desire.</h3>
    <h3>The alternative method utilizes a stamping tool which simplifies the batik-making process. With the cloth on a table, the copper stamper is submerged in hot wax and ironed onto the fabric. This way, the design may be repeated for other garments at a much more efficient speed.</h3>
    <h3>There are a few places on the island that teach how to make batik. Widya Batik in Gianyar is a popular option.</h3>

    <h2>39. Learn traditional Balinese massages in a day – Jamu Spa School</h2>
    <h3>If your friends are always complaining that you’re killing them when you offer to give them a massage, maybe it’s time to improve your skills with an internationally acknowledged massage therapist diploma at Jamu Spa School in Nusa Dua.</h3>
    <h3>School can be fun and speedy with Jamu Spa School’s one-day Balinese massage class, where you can master the techniques of the traditional Balinese full-body massage. It won’t turn you into a professional massage therapist overnight, but it’s great fun and you can test out your skills – we mean surprise your loved one or friends – back home.</h3>
    <h3>Kneading, rolling, squeezing, pounding, and stroking – all these are part of the traditional Balinese full-body massage, the first method of healing in Bali.</h3>
    <h3>During the workshop, you’ll get to both practise and experience the Balinese massage, as well as act as a therapist and model for your fellow students! So be careful – any pain you inflict is very likely going to be returned to you by a vengeful fellow student.</h3>
    <h3>Just kidding – it’s almost hard to be bad when you’ve got experienced, skillful and patient instructors who ensure that all their students learn the trade. At the end of the day, you’ll return home with a certificate in your pocket and two golden hands attached to your arms.</h3>
    <h3>Apart from the Balinese massage class, you can also join in for the one-day baby massage course, the one-day Kerokan (coin scraping) course or the one-day boreh body wrap course.</h3>

    <h2>41. Enjoy the Majestic, Scenic Drive to the Ocean – Melasti Beach</h2>
    <h3>One of the things that set Melasti Beach apart is its towering cliffs that surround the beach, creating a sense of seclusion, however, don’t be deceived by it as this is a popular spot for tourists and locals alike!</h3>
    <h3>This beach is known to be a sacred site for local Balinese people, and if you’re lucky, you might chance upon traditional ceremonies taking place!</h3>
    <h3>Unlike many other beaches in Uluwatu, there’s no hiking required to come here. You’ll just have to drive down to the beach (or ride down on a scooter). The drive through the winding roads and limestone cliffs is simply breathtaking.</h3>
    <h3>Along the way, there are several viewpoints that offer panoramic vistas of the surrounding landscapes. This beach is also popular for <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/wedding-photoshoot-places-bali/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wedding photoshoots in Bali</a> due to its cliffs, caves, turquoise waters, and golden sands.</h3>

    <h2>42. Take a romantic escape to the Nusa islands</h2>
    <h3>Comprising three main islands — Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan — this stunning cluster of landforms exudes a magical charm that is hard to resist.</h3>

    <h3>Renowned for their breathtaking landscapes, the <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/nusa-lembongan-ceningan-penida-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nusa Islands</a> boast dramatic cliffs, lush jungles, and pristine beaches that beckon adventurers and nature enthusiasts alike. While day trips to the Nusa Islands are possible, we suggest spending at least one to two nights in one of <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/nusa-islands-private-pool-villas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their romantic ocean-view villas</a>.</h3>
    <h3><b>1. Nusa Penida </b></h3>
    <h3>A short 30-minute boat ride from Bali, Nusa Penida is the largest of the three Nusa islands. The island is relatively undeveloped and you will find only a limited number of hotels here, meaning privacy is often a given. What sets it apart from its sister islands is the plethora of unspoiled natural attractions and untouched landscapes.</h3>

    <h3><b>2. Nusa Lembongan </b></h3>
    <h3>Just like the other Nusa Islands, Nusa Lembongan is accessible via a 30-minute boat ride from Bali. Here, you can enjoy the perfect combination of the old Indonesia and the comforts of modern hotels, resorts and villas.</h3>
	<figure><img class="normal aligncenter wp-image-80515" src="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/A-1-2-Ohana-by-@emnaiori@thelembongantraveller.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="325"><figcaption class="op-vertical-below" style="margin-top: -30px;text-align: center;margin-bottom: 30px;font-style: italic;font-size: 12px">Photo Via emnaiori, thelembongantraveller</figcaption></figure>

    <h3>Nusa Lembongan offers beautiful white-sand beaches and gin-clear lagoons waiting to be explored. There are also plenty of restaurants, cool cafes, and beach clubs spread around the island.</h3>
    <h3><b>3. Nusa Ceningan </b></h3>
    <h3>Nusa Ceningan is the smallest of the three Nusa Islands. It sits right in between the bigger islands of Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan. Seaweed farming is a major activity on the island of Nusa Ceningan, and many of its locals depend on this business for survival.</h3>
